This repo is created on October,2, 2018, main purpose is to urge myself to learn related skills, including machine learning, deep learning and optimization algorithms, etc.

This repo is roughly divided into four parts:

- machine learning
- deep learning
- optimization learning
- programming learning

> **Note:** don't study for just learning, whereas study to improve yourself
